# four in a row
Four in a game I created for reasons that I can't elaborate online.

Native Python game made with TKinter, 4 in a row game that saves the results to a log file and allow to continue a game from where it stoped.
The OOP is quite simple to and contained in one file full of explanations and comments.

Would love to hear some feedback <3
